Hello Profesor ...


There is our proposed project and we would like to know if doing something like this will be possible as final project for this class.

Few shot learning above HAM10000 dataset

its the dataset of various different (5) skin cancers with lots of healthy skin as well, so for project we would like to do:

- cherry pick smaller image set consisting of images with better quality and contrasts (the whole dataset has 10k images)
- preprocesting the images to get rid of excess healthy skin around as it can lower the success rate
- finding out if rotating images have any impact on the results



Confution matrix:

Critical -> False negative
small -> False possitive



stuff from teacher: 


fuzzy logic
overlay

extract based on metadata -> statistical model

- compare accuracy and AUC for every body part 
- find paper with similar setup to ours and compare results 
- resnet18

- prepare for labwork "test"




    hand: accuracy=0.6000, auc=0.9167
    upper extremity: accuracy=0.1429, auc=0.9583            -> good AUC, but terrible at guessing the type of cancers
    abdomen: train=27, test=7, accuracy=0.7143, auc=0.8333

    Any AUC computed with <20 samples is unstable.

    maybe per sex accuracy as well
