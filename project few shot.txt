There is our proposed project and we would like to know if doing something like this will be possible as final project for this class.

Few shot learning above HAM10000 dataset

its the dataset of various different (5) skin cancers with lots of healthy skin as well, so for project we would like to do:

- cherry pick smaller image set consisting of images with better quality and contrasts (the whole dataset has 10k images)
- preprocesting the images to get rid of excess healthy skin around as it can lower the success rate
- finding out if rotating images have any impact on the results



Confution matrix:

Critical -> False negative
small -> False possitive
